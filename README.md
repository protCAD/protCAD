===================================================================================================

protCAD is an implementation of the protein design software library that originated in the 
Bill Degrado Protein Design Lab.

It is currently maintained by The Vikas Nanda Lab: https://sites.google.com/site/viknanda
The source is maintained at: https://github.com/protCAD/protcad

Publications to date on protCAD's methods and implementaions are:

-Computational Methods and their Applications for de novo Functional Protein Design and Memebrane 
 Protein Solubilization, Summa CM Thesis 2002

-Empirical estimation of local dielectric constants: Toward atomistic design of collagen mimetic 
 peptides, Biopolymers - Peptide Science. Pike & Nanda 2015; 104(4): 360-70.


 Installation
===================================================================================================

=== Install dependencies

--Windows 10

First you will need to follow instructions to install the windows ubuntu sub-system as there is no
native support for windows libraries: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10
Then follow the Ubuntu Linux install dependency instructions and install below in the sub-system terminal.

--Ubuntu Linux:

In terminal:

sudo apt-get install g++ gfortran git;

--Mac:

In terminal install dev tools, homebrew and then dependencies:

xcode-select --install

/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

brew install gcc gfortran git


=== Install

For all systems download source and compile via these terminal commands:

git clone https://github.com/protCAD/protcad 

cd protcad

make install

Then close and re-open the terminal


 Usage
===================================================================================================

General use programs are compiled via make install and the source is available in protcad/projects.

Since make install also adds the bin directory to your path, programs in projects are immediately 
available to run in any directory.

An overview of the general use programs are described below:


--protAlign

pdb onto the first.

--protEnergy

Description: Calculates the total energy of the protein in kcal/mol.

Input command: protEnergy <inFile.pdb>
Output result: Total Energy of the protein, total clashes and total backbone-backbone clashes

 Development process
===================================================================================================

New programs need to be added to the Makefile in protcad/ for compilation and added to projects 
directory which then can be compiled via 'make programx'.

Additional examples are in the protcad/src/tests folder for reference and usage, which can be added
to the projects directory and MakeFile for compilation.  Some tests may not compile as they were 
developed on a much earlier version of protcad but most will compile without issue.

New programs written are intended to follow the same directory structure and compilation as 
in projects.  Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think 
their feature or bug fix is ready.

The master branch is regularly built and tested. Tags are regularly created to indicate new
official, stable release versions of protCAD.

The dev branch is a more frequently updated branch with a more experimental version being developed
but generally ready for usage. To switch to the dev branch in the protad directory use the command:

git checkout dev
make install


 Issues
===================================================================================================
Bugs and issues can be submitted into the issues section of http://www.github.com/protcad/protcad repo or a
description of the issue and result can be emailed to Douglas Pike at doughp11@gmail.com
